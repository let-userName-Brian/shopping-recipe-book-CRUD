# Shopping List / Recipe App

This app was built to practice my fundamentals of Angular. I was able to 
utilize services throughout the app to better understand the built in state 
management that Angular offers.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/let-userName-Brian/shopping-recipe-book-CRUD.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd shopping-recipe-book-CRUD
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server
